When designing my system, I first thought about what the user would need to understand what is happening in the game. First, the OLED was implemented because it was the first requirement that needed to be filled as well as I can use it to provide instructions to guide the player. Next I thought about LED because besides just reading the screen, I figured it would be better to have more visual feedback about their progress, so I added three LEDs (green,blue, and red), to show things like: properly matching the numbers on the screen with the green light, the numbers not matching with the red light, and the board being in an idle state before the game starts with a blinking blue light. As we had to change our project, we needed a new way for the user to interact with the board, so I added two push buttons for them to be able to control the game.
