**Choice:** Option 1: NHD-C12832A1Z-FSW-FBW-3V3 Display

**Rationale**: Option 1 will provide a better user experience for our exhibit. The white background and black text will make it very easy to read and easier on the userâ€™s eyes. The screen and pixel count is large enough to get the level of detail we plan for our exhibit game. It uses an SPI interface which is the ideal choice for communication and it is the cheapest option.
